            <h2>World Setting</h2>
            <p>Long ago, the <b>Kingdom of Ignoram</b> was a place of brilliance, where libraries soared like castles
                and every
                child was a hero of learning. But one day, King Ignoramous rose to power. Jealous of others' knowledge
                and afraid of questions, he declared learning dangerous. He shut down schools, burned books (but only
                the confusing ones), and replaced puzzles with coloring inside the lines.
                <br>
                Now, most grown-ups shuffle through life without curiosity. But the spark of wonder still glows in the
                hearts of children. When twin sisters, Misha and Lexi, sneak into the Forbidden Forest to chase a
                legend,
                they discover a hidden cave filled with glowing scrolls, mechanical owls, and magical chalkboards.
                There, they meet the last living teacher—<b>Ms. Wizzlewick</b>—who entrusts them with enchanted tools of
                learning before vanishing in a swirl of glittery smoke.
                <br>
                As new <b>Seekers of Knowledge</b>, they must rally other brave kids, recover lost wisdom, and break the
                kingdom's curse—not with swords and fire, but with books, math, logic, and kindness. Their adventure
                isn't just about winning battles—it's about reminding everyone what it means to free thinkers!

            <h2>The Lore of Ignoram</h2>
            <h3>🌟 The Age of Enlighten (Before Ignoramous)</h3>
            <p><em>“In the days before silence, the world was written in ink and sung in numbers.”</em></p>
            <p>
                Long ago, Ignoram was called <strong>Lumenaria</strong>, a kingdom known as the Realm of Light and
                Learning.
                Children explored story gardens, tamed beasts with riddles, and ate fruit from the Arithmetica Tree to
                learn equations.
            </p>

            <h3>🦠 The Rise of King Ignoramous</h3>
            <div class="row align-items-start">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                <p><em>“Fear is a book’s oldest enemy.”</em></p>
            
                <p>
                Born as Prince Galdo Ignoramous, a struggling student, he grew bitter with every failure. Every mark on
                his work fed his resentment for the education 'system'. Upon taking the throne, he outlawed curiosity.
                Schools became silent, questions forbidden, and books replaced by coloring pages. Thus began the
                <strong>Law of Quiet Minds</strong>.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>🔥 The Great Dimming</h3>
            <p><em>“First the lights of the Library Towers went out. Then the stories stopped singing.”</em></p>
            <p>
                The Library Towers were sealed, learning banned, and magical cities like <strong>Academica</strong>
                became ruins.
                But even now, whispers of resistance remain...
            </p>

            <h3>🔮 Prophecy of the Quill</h3>
            <blockquote>
                “When two minds of mirrored soul<br>
                Find where scrolls in silence roll,<br>
                The Wand shall wake, the Sword shall sing,<br>
                And learning shall return with spring.”
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Many believe the twin sisters are the ones foretold. Whether legend or fate, the spark has been lit.
